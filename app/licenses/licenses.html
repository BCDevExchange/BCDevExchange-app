            <p>BCDevX is all about sharing. Sharing data, sharing APIs, sharing applications, and sharing knowledge.
            However, sometimes to share something, you need to specifically indicate how something is being shared, so that other
            people can clearly understand how they can use it. To indicate the conditions under which something is being shared,
            people use licenses.</p>
            <p>The BCDevX Policy Team was tasked with researching and finding licenses.
            In the BCDevX spirit of openness and collaboration, we looked for licenses that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Are Open Source</li>
                <li>Are as simple to navigate and manage as possible</li>
                <li>Use the norms of the create community to the extent possible</li>
                <li>Maximize commercial opportunities</li>
                <li>Provide clarity as to what users and re-users are permitted to do and whether there are any restrictions on those permissions</li>
                <li>Maximize the opportunities for use and re-use of public-sector generated digital resources</li>
                <li>Provide adequate assurance that rights to any intellectual property contained in contributions are clearly and appropriately assigned</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Using these guidelines, the Policy Team identified three key licenses that they think should cover
            more than 99% of what we expect to be shared through BCDevX.</p>

            <p><a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT</a>, commonly used for software, is considered the most commonly used license,
                and is a simple grant, copyright notice requirement, and disclaimer of warranty.</p>
            <p><a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache License 2.0</a>, also commonly used for software, is pretty much functionally equivalent to the MIT license, but
            includes a contributor license agreement with an explicit patent grant.</p>
            <p><a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/)">Creative Commons</a> (specifically the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license), is used for non-software
            related items (such as the development of design specifications through an open source process), and was created to
            encourage the 'open source' use of expressions other than software, such as text, music and film.</p>

            <h3>Going Forward</h3>
            <p>Although we think the above licenses will cover the majority of content shared through BCDevX, there will
            undoubtedly be cases that require different licensing considerations. So, although this list of 'core' licenses may
            change over time, the initial intention is to establish a very small number of licenses that will accommodate
            the anticipated project types and are aligned with the BCDevX objectives, to help streamline the process for sharing.</p>
