## Deployment ##

To deploy you must first have your development environment setup on your workstation.  In addition, the grunt-cli installed globally:

`$ npm install -g grunt-cli`

For each deployment, the /app/* folder is pushed to the BCDevX.github.io repo master branch.  In a shell from the root of the source code, use the command:

`$ grunt`
