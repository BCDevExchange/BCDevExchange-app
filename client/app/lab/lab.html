                <p>The Labs are a safe place for early adopter public sector members of the BCDevExchange to experiment in the open. They are a reflection of the BCDevExchange’s commitment to open development and co-creation.</p>

                <p>In the Labs you will find experiments; ideas that need to be proven. Everything in the Labs needs to be tested, validated and refined. Like any experiments, some will work and others will fail. So be prepared that some of what you see here will disappear.</p>

                <p>Work in the Labs will be tagged with either ‘Inspiration’ or ‘Exploration’. Inspiration means early stage, back-of-the-napkin type of ideas. Exploration contains work that is functional and can be tested, such as working software, but that is not ‘production ready.’</p>
